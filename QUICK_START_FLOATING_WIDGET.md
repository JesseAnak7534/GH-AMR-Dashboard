## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific** → "What's the resistance pattern for E. coli in Accra?" (better than "Tell me about resistance")
2. **Ask Follow-ups** → "Why is that?" or "What should we do?" (AI remembers context)
3. **Mix Topics** → Ask data questions, then request recommendations
4. **Use Context** → "Last month we saw..." helps AI understand changes
5. **Request Actions** → "What would you recommend?" gets actionable insights
